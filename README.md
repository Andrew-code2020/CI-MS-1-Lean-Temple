# Temple Lean
Code institute milestone project MS projects Gym

Temple Lean is a small sole trader style fitness facility at the heart of Cork City Ireland. Temple Lean prides itself on high quality client fitness services and classes.
Temple Lean currently caters for young professional clients usually aged 18-45 years. General (on the floor of the gym) and survey feedback has indicated that an online platform is needed to help retain existing business and open up new leads to potential clients.
Recently the Corporate Ireland market along with strong emphasis from state bodies on physical activity has lead to increased demand for services at Temple Lean. To ensure good customer relations management and clean flow of services a website is considered a top priority for Temple Lean. 

### UX
The key reasons for producing the website were;
* help current users learn about the fitness facility Temple Lean
* help new potential users learn easily about the fitness services Temple Lean offer
* help new potential users connect and communicate easily with the team at Temple Lean
* help new potential users connect and communicate easily with the team at Temple Lean via Social Media
* help the gym owner attract and retain clients

At the outset the minimum viable product was determined to be a communication platform between the owner/operator(s) of Temple Lean and the current clients. 
It was an objective of that website to include an intuitive design which would allow new potential clients to navigate and enagage with the website without any prior engagement with Temple Lean and it's services. Current and potential client surveys were conducted to assess the minumim effective information required to illicit a positive emotional response from users. 
This information was incredibly valuable during the construction of wireframes for the website. At the outset conventional web design features were favoured.The vision for the project was to have a website that displayed basic information on Temple Lean services but that offered quick access to open communication with Temple Lean.
